# DH100Proj

This is the repository for Jasper Zhou's Digital Humanities 100 Project. For this project, I have two goals:

1.  Analyze how fake and real news has changed over time
2.  Create a classification model to classify fake and real news.

I will be using a the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

This project is still a work in progress and will be updated shortly.
