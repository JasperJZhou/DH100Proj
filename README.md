# Explanation of Contents

This is the repository for Jasper Zhou's Digital Humanities 100 Project, Summer 2021.
It contains the following items:

1.  DIGHUM100Proj_JasperZhou.ipynb: This is the python notebook used to generate all code and visualizations
2.  Storyboards: This is the iterative versions of the storyboard
3.  Data: No csv is actually hosted in this folder. It contains a markdown file with a link to the Kaggle Dataset I used. Unfortunately, the dataset was far too large to host in GitHub
4.  Storyboard_Jasper: This is the final poster seen above in the Readme.md file. Specifically, these are the .png converted pdfs.

In addititon, this following [Google Drive portfolio](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1X-jaMsc37yvi9HbzcS3hPvMXw-ydm0Pw) contains a 5-minute video explanation and the slides used in the aforementioned video.
